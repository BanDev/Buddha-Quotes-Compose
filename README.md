## About The Project

<img src="assets/showcase.gif" height="600" />

This project is a complete rewrite of [Buddha Quotes](https://github.com/BanDev/Buddha-Quotes) in [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose). We have the intention of adding every feature that was in the original Buddha Quotes into this project, but as shown in the roadmap, not every feature has been added yet. The flexibility of writing in Jetpack Compose has meant that we are able to write quicker and seeing as we are writing this from the ground up, we have added a few new features already, such as a Daily Quote.

## Built With

* Jetpack Compose
* Kotlin
* Kotlin Coroutines
* Room Database
* Hilt
* Proto Datastore
* MVVM Architecture

## Getting Started

As this project is incomplete and always changing, there are no releases yet. Once we are happy that all core features have been added, we will merge this project with [Buddha Quotes](https://github.com/BanDev/Buddha-Quotes). Until then, you can absolutely build this project from source or even contribute, if you so wish.

### Prerequisites

To build Buddha Quotes Compose, you will need Android Studio Canary. This will come preinstalled with every tool necessary to build the app, such as JDK 11 and Gradle.

1. Install [Android Studio Canary](https://developer.android.com/studio/preview)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/BanDev/Buddha-Quotes-Compose.git
```

2. Build the project

```sh
./gradlew build
```

## Roadmap

As this project is written from scratch in Jetpack Compose, not everything has been added from the original [Buddha Quotes](https://github.com/BanDev/Buddha-Quotes).

- [x] Show new quote
- [x] Daily quote
- [x] Favouriting a quote
- [x] Meditation timer
- [x] Libraries page
- [ ] Viewing lists
- [ ] Editing lists
- [ ] Adding a quote to a list
- [ ] About page
- [ ] Widgets (Compose API not yet released but is on [roadmap](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/compose-roadmap))
